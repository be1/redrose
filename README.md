# Redrose
ABC music notation integrated environment

## Dependencies
Redrose uses third-party software to generate MIDI, AUDIO, SVG and Postscript files.
- drumstick-file (library and headers)
- fluidsynth (library and headers)
- abc2midi (program, optional, not mandatory)

Note that Redrose uses a *modified* version of the open source abcm2ps code, maintained in a specific submodule.
