# Redrose
ABC music notation integrated environment

## Dependencies
Redrose uses third-party software to generate MIDI, AUDIO, SVG and Postscript files.
- abc2midi (program, not mandatory)
- drumstick-file (library and headers)
- fluidsynth (library and headers)

Note that Redrose uses a *modified* version of the open source abcm2ps code, maintained in a specific submodule.
Original `abcm2ps` code is Copyright Â© 2014-2016 Jean-Francois Moine.

Note that Redrose provides an optionnal internal abc notation parser and MIDI generator.

cd ..
```
## Building
Just a matter of:

$ make
# make install (as root)
```

## Starting
Launch `redrose` by clicking on the red rose icon, click on Score->New and type some ABC music in the editor, press `Play` button: you're done!

## Bugs
Probably lots of!

This project is based on previously QAbc experimental `fluid` branch.
